# Airlines Dataset Feature Engineering Lab

In this lab, I explore the Airlines dataset and apply feature transformation techniques we learned in the Feature Engineering lesson.

## Dataset
The Airlines dataset contains information on flight prices, routes, and other attributes. We will use this dataset to explore techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and dimensionality reduction.

This is the link to the dataset: https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-ML0232EN-SkillsNetwork/asset/airlines_data.xlsx

## Getting Started
To get started, I download the Airlines dataset, which is provided in the airlines_data.csv file.

## Requirements
To run the code in the Jupyter Notebook, you will need to have the following packages installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

## Instructions
Open the airlines_feature_engineering.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and follow the instructions provided in the notebook to perform feature engineering on the Airlines dataset. You will learn techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, and dimensionality reduction.

Conclusion
By the end of this lab, I have gained valuable experience in applying feature engineering techniques to real-world datasets. These skills are essential for any data scientist who wants to be able to work with messy data and turn it into actionable insights.
